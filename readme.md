# Data Science with Python

These are notes I compiled after watching the following Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-data-science

The Complete Notebook for this project can be found [Here](DemoNotebook.ipynb)

## :notebook: Install Anaconda

Before we begin, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

### What is Anaconda?

 An open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. 
 
 It aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages.

## :book: Setting up Jupyter Notebook

- Open Anaconda Prompt
- Execute command `jupyter notebook`
- The browser will open `http://localhost:8888/tree`
- Select 'New' > 'Python Notebook'


## :runner: Run code in cells

- `CTRL + ENTER` to execute cell
- `SHIFT + ENTER` to execute cell and create a new one
- `ESC + M` to convert cell to markdown
- `ESC + L` to add line numbers
- `!` to execute shell commands on your machine

## :sparkles: Magic functions

- A single line starts with `%`
- A multi-line starts with `%%`
- `%matplotlib` to plot graphs
- `%time` to measure execution times of operations
- `%%writefile` to create and write to files
- `%ls` to list directories
