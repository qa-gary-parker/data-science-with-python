 - It aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages

## :book: Setting up Jupyter Notebook

- Open Anaconda Prompt
- Execute command `jupyter notebook`
- The browser will open `http://localhost:8888/tree`
- Select 'New' > 'Python Notebook'


## :runner: Run code in cells

- `CTRL + ENTER` to execute cell
- `SHIFT + ENTER` to execute cell and create a new one
- `ESC + M` to convert cell to markdown
- `ESC + L` to add line numbers
- `!` to execute shell commands on your machine

## :sparkles: Magic functions
